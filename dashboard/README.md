## **🤖 Synthetics and Alerts 🚨**
### **🤖Synthetics**
Synthetic monitoring is a suite of automated, scriptable tools to monitor your websites, critical business transactions, and API endpoints. 

We use them to  simulate user traffic to proactively detect and resolve outages and poor performance of critical endpoints before our real customers.
